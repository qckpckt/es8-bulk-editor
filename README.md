# Boss ES-8 Bulk Editor

## DISCLAIMER

This is a community-built resource and has absolutely no affiliation or association with Roland corp. Use of this tool to bulk edit your patches may result in a voided warranty, data loss, and even permanent damage to your ES- or MS- series device. You use this tool completely at your own risk.

The maintainers of this repository are in no way responsible for damage to your ES-8, ES-5, MS-3, or indeed any other product that you attempt to use this tool with.

**ALWAYS** back up your ES-8 patches before attempting a bulk edit.

## Overview

This tool is being developed in order to provide the ability to make edits globally to your ES-8 device that are not possible with the current version of the ES-8 editor. It is accomplished by parsing and modifying the patch backup file that can be generated by the ES-8 editor as opposed to interacting with the ES-8 unit directly.

## Examples

### Swapping loops globally

Lets say you buy a new pedal that has stereo outs, and want to put it in loop 7, but you have an existing pedal in that slot and a large number of existing patches that use this loop in various configurations. Your plan is to remove a pedal from another loop (let's say 6), and to move the pedal currently in loop 7 to loop 6. With the ES-8 editor, you would need to go through every patch you have that uses loop 7 and manually swap it with loop 6. This can be a painful, dull, slow process. This tool aims to automate this by allowing you to specify which loops you want to swap, and what logic to use in the process (straight swap, or swap and wipe for example).

### Creating global assigns

It is common practice to assign a footswitch on the ES-8 to control tap tempo, and it makes sense that you use the same footswitch on every patch for ease of use. Currently, you would need to manually create this assign for every new patch you use, or copy settings over from an existing patch (more on this later). This tool will have an option to create and apply (or remove) an assign to all patches globally.

### Create a meta-patch

It is also common practice to create a base patch with commonly used assigns, loop placements, i/o settings etc to use as a template for other patches. This is easily achievable using the bulk copy commands in the ES-8 editor. But, what if you need to *change* this meta-patch? Currently there is no way to accomplish this without either manually editing all patches or creating a meta-patch and wiping everything else out.

The bulk editor will include a feature that will let you update all existing patches to match a new patch template.

## How it works

The ES-8 backup file, which uses a `.bel` file extension, is effectively just a relatively flat JSON object. All patches are stored as a list of objects, from 0 to 799. This makes it very simple to iterate over the objects and upate them with a set of changes.

The challenge comes from understanding the settings themselves. Each discrete parameter is stored as an array of integers. Some of these are easy to decipher, such as loop numbers and order, but others are less clear. Additionally, some parameters have a mix of recognizable values and ones that do not correspond to anything recognizable in the UI of either the editor or the unit itself.

As such, this project will involve a lot of careful trial and error to determine what settings do what. This is compounded by the fact that the impact of loading a backup file that is improperly formatted is unknown. My expectation is that it could very well be catastrophically bad. I am attempting to contact Roland to get clarification on this but I expect the process to be slow and also fruitless.

To that end, this tool will include an extensive testing and validation suite that will be designed to limit the chance of damaging a unit; but this will certainly not be an elimination of all risk.
